          Anomalous Audio Data Generation (AADG), a framework that synthetically
          generates real life Audio Data with Anomalies by leveraging LLMs as a
          world model

          We introduce a novel, general purpose audio generation framework
          specifically designed for Audio Anomaly Detection(AAD) and
          Localization. Unlike existing datasets that predominantly focus on
          industrial and machine-related sounds, our framework focuses on a
          broader range of environments, particularly useful in real-world
          scenarios where only audio data are available, such as telephonic
          audio. To generate such data, we propose a new method, Anomalous Audio
          Data Generation(AADG), inspired by the LLM-Modulo
          <a href="">[1]</a> framework, which leverages Large Language
          Models(LLMs) as world models to simulate such real-world scenarios.
          This tool is modular, allowing for a plug-and-play approach. It works
          by first using LLMs to predict plausible real-world scenarios. An LLM
          further extracts the constituent sounds, the order and the way in
          which these should be merged to create coherent wholes. Constituent
          audios are then generated using text-to-audio models and merged based
          on the LLM's instructions. We include a rigorous verification of each
          output stage, ensuring the reliability of the generated data. The data
          produced using Anomalous Audio Data Generation (AADG) allows us to
          train an anomaly detection model which we test on real-world data to
          prove the effectiveness of our framework. We also show the
          shortcomings of current SOTA audio models, particularly in handling
          out-of-distribution scenarios thus making a case for improving their
          performance by including data using AADG. Our contributions fill a
          critical void in audio anomaly detection resources and provide a
          scalable tool for generating diverse, realistic audio data.

        Illustration of the pipeline for generating and verifying anomalous
        audio data. The process begins with scene generation, followed by
        information extraction using a Large Language Model (LLM). Individual
        audio components are synthesized from text descriptions and meticulously
        verified for accuracy and merged according to LLM instructions,
        culminating in a dataset of realistic anomalous audio.

    <div class="conclusion-block">
      <p>
        The proposed framework, <strong>AADG</strong>, allows scalable and
        realistic anomalous audio data generation. Unlike traditional datasets
        that focus on industrial sounds, it leverages LLMs to simulate
        real-world scenarios, making it particularly valuable for audio-only
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The modular design enables integration of various LLMs and text-to-audio
        models, allowing the generation of complex, anomalous scenarios that are
        hard to capture in real-world data. While current text-to-audio models
        still face challenges with generating realistic audio for complex
        prompts and anomalies, the framework introduces multi-stage verification
        processes to minimize logical flaws, misalignment, and inconsistent
        outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, we train a benchmark anomaly detection model on synthetic
        AADG data and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world test cases.
        Although this process still has limitations in handling certain
        out-of-distribution cases, we fill a critical gap in the field by
        providing a tool for creating diverse and realistic datasets, which are
        essential for advancing audio anomaly detection.
